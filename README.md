Bryce_Yncera_Personal_Project
============================

My group project was a tremendous learning experience in regards to working with WordPress due to the fact that I did not know that word press existed before this class. 
However I did not have the opportunity to fully implement some of the features that WordPress offers, due to the requirements that Skytouch had in the project. 
The main thing was we had to use a very basic theme that had little to no functionality besides changing the CSS of the website.
That is why in my personal Project I created a fictional company website that utilizes a more robust theme. The theme that I used is called Vantage made by siteorigin. 
Unlike most themes that are on WordPress that are strictly for the CSS of the website. This theme allows you to customize your website far more than other themes on WordPress 
You are able to insert contact forms, sideshows product pages and more as well as the basic CSS that other themes allow you to do without the need of adding in more plugins.
I will now be going over how I implemented the theme and the functionality of the theme. For reference the link to my live website is listed here: http://bynceraproject.com/

Contact Form
============================
Contact Forms are an essential part of any companies website. The great thing about the Vantage theme is that it allows you to create contact forms with in the page, without 
having to download and maintain other plugins as shown below.
